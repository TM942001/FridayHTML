<h3>1.Pharmacy Department:</h3>
<img src="pharmacyy.jpg" height="400" width="800" />
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharmacy is the clinical health science that links
    medical science with chemistry and it is charged with the discovery, production, disposal, safe and effective use,
    and control of medications and drugs. The practice of pharmacy requires excellent knowledge of drugs, their
    mechanism of action, side effects, interactions, mobility and toxicity. At the same time, it requires knowledge of
    treatment and understanding of the pathological process. Some specialties of pharmacists, such as that of clinical
    pharmacists, require other skills, e.g. knowledge about the acquisition and evaluation of physical and laboratory
    data.[1]

    The scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as compounding and dispensing of medications,
    and it also includes more modern services related to health care, including clinical services, reviewing medications
    for safety and efficacy, and providing drug information. Pharmacists, therefore, are the experts on drug therapy and
    are the primary health professionals who optimize the use of medication for the benefit of the patients.
